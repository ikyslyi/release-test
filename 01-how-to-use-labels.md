# How to Use GitHub Issue Labels Effectively

Applying and managing labels properly in your GitHub repository helps improve issue tracking, prioritization, and overall project management. Hereâ€™s how to use them effectively:

---

## **1. Assign Labels When Creating a New Issue**
- When a new issue is created, apply **Issue Type Labels** to categorize it.
- For example:

  - If itâ€™s a bug, assign the **`type/bug`** label.
  - If itâ€™s a feature request, assign the **`type/feature request`** label.
  - If itâ€™s a documentation issue, assign **`type/documentation`**.

**Example:**
_A contributor reports a login error â†’ Assign **`type/bug`** label._

---

## **2. Define the Priority**
- Use **Priority Labels** to indicate the urgency of the issue.
  - **`priority/high`** â†’ Needs immediate attention.
  - **`priority/medium`** â†’ Important but not urgent.
  - **`priority/low`** â†’ Nice to have but not critical.

**Example:**
_A security vulnerability is found â†’ Assign **`type/bug`** + **`priority/high`**._

---

## **3. Track the Status of the Issue**
- As the issue progresses, update its **Status Label**:
  - **`status/needs review`** â†’ Needs input before work begins.
  - **`status/in progress`** â†’ Someone is actively working on it.
  - **`status/blocked`** â†’ Work cannot proceed due to dependencies.
  - **`status/awaiting feedback`** â†’ Waiting for a response from the author or team.
  - **`status/ready for testing`** â†’ Code is complete and needs verification.

**Example:**
_A contributor is fixing a bug â†’ Change from **`status/needs review`** â†’ **`status/in progress`**._

---

## **4. Mark Resolution When Issue is Closed**
- Once an issue is resolved, apply a **Resolution Label** before closing it:
  - **`resolution/fixed`** â†’ The problem was resolved successfully and closed.
  - **`resolution/wonâ€™t fix`** â†’ Acknowledged but will not be fixed.
  - **`resolution/duplicate`** â†’ Similar to another reported issue.
  - **`resolution/invalid`** â†’ Incorrect or not an actual issue.
  - **`resolution/works as intended`** â†’ Not a bug; intended behavior.

**Example:**
_A reported bug was fixed â†’ Apply **`fixed`** and close the issue._

---

## **5. Encourage Community Participation**
- Use **Community Labels** to encourage contributions:
  - **`discussion`** â†’ Open-ended brainstorming or planning.
  - **`stale`** â†’ Has been inactive for an extended period.
  
**Example:**
_An feature request that was inactive for a long time â†’ Assign **`type/feature request`** + **`stale`**._

---

## **Example Workflow**
1. A user reports that the login feature is broken.

   - Label: **`type/bug`**, **`priority/high`**, **`status/needs review`**.

2. A maintainer reviews the issue, confirms it, and assigns a developer.

   - Label changes: **`status/in progress`**.

3. Developer completes the fix and submits a pull request.

   - Label changes: **`status/ready for testing`**.

4. The fix is tested and merged.

   - Label changes: **`resolution/fixed`**.

   - Issue is closed.


By consistently applying labels and updating them as issues progress, your GitHub repository will remain **organized, transparent, and efficient** for both maintainers and contributors. ðŸš€
